# Virtual Trivia Game

> Customizable booth trivia created for exhibitors for a virtual conference


## Project Info

Once a quiz has been created using the [Virtual Trivia Form](https://github.com/CrystalElseyNSS/virtual-trivia-form), the Virtual Trivia Game uses Firebase Functions to pull the quiz data from Firebase Cloud Firestore to dynamically populate the quiz, using the Exhibitor Attendee Id as a url parameter. The front-end was built using Vanilla JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, and CSS.

> Test it out live at https://booth-quiz-form.web.app/   
> View your new quiz at https://sw-booth-trivia.web.app/ + {Exhibitor Attendee Id}
